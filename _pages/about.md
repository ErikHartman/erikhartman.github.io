I am a PhD student in computational biology at the [infection medicine proteomics lab](https://portal.research.lu.se/en/organisations/infection-medicine-proteomics), [Lund University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/), Sweden. The goal of my PhD is to gain further understanding into protein degradation using computational methods.

I've been passionate about science and research for as long as I can remember, and am alumni of [Anders Wall Schlolars](https://www.wallstiftelsen.se/), the [Swedish Society for Young Scientist (Unga Forskare)](https://ungaforskare.se/), [Society for Science](https://www.societyforscience.org/), [International Science and Engineering Fair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Science_and_Engineering_Fair) and [international Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM)](https://igem.org/).
