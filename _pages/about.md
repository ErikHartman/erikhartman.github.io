I am a researcher in computational biology / bioinformatics at the [infection medicine proteomics lab](https://portal.research.lu.se/en/organisations/infection-medicine-proteomics), [Lund University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/), Sweden. My research centers around contriving computational methods in means of gaining previously unattainable insight from [omics-data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omics) (mainly [MS/MS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandem_mass_spectrometry) proteomics and peptidomics), which in turn could be used to create new therapeutics and means of diagnosis.

I've been passionate about science and research for as long as I can remember, and am alumni of the [Swedish Society for Young Scientist (Unga Forskare)](https://ungaforskare.se/), [Society for Science](https://www.societyforscience.org/), [International Science and Engineering Fair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Science_and_Engineering_Fair) and [international Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM)](https://igem.org/). I co-created the international organization [SynthEthics](https://www.facebook.com/synthethicsinitiative/) which dealt with the ethics of synthetic biology (although since disbanded). My interests span from effective altruism and consciousness to evolution and computational science. I'm also an avid communicator, and have been a part of various podcasts and articles.

Beyond my interests in science, I'm a powerlifter ([OpenIPF](https://www.openipf.org/u/erikhartman)) and head of the local powerlifting club.
