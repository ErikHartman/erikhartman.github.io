**BMEN35: Data-driven health (Faculty of Engineering, Lund University)** 
I was a lecturer and held a computer exercise in the course in 2022 and 2023. 

**Synthetic biology for beginners**
In 2020 I wrote a compendium to introduce high school students to synthetic biology. I held trial lectures for the compendium at Katedralskolan, Lund, Sweden. The compendium can be found <a href="../assets/pdf/sb_for_beginners.pdf">here</a>.
