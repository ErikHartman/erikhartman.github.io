Games are fundamental to the behavior of living organisms, and most biological, societal, and economic systems can be understood using game theory. In game theory, a game is defined by a set of players, a set of rules, and a set of objectives. In large, the goal of game theory is to define and study games, and in doing so, it can help to define policies (rules) and actions which optimize the process of reaching an objective. Life is perhaps the most rudimentary of all games, in which players constitute living organisms, and the natural objectives include surviving, flourishing and procreating. Wars can easily be likened to games, where the goal could be to conquer land or subdue a population. Naturally, tactics become important in games, and a large part of game theoretic endeavors lies in identifying the optimal tactics (actions) which result in the desired outcome of a game. 

When breaking down a complex system into a set of games, it becomes possible to define policies which shift the incentives of players to favor a desired outcome. Here, I will try to break down the world of academia into a set of games, to showcase that the incentives and goals of the key players in the game are misaligned, and that the current setup of rules and policies of academia are resulting in unfavorable outcomes which doesn’t benefit humanity.

## The game of academia
A game which all researchers are familiar with is that of academia and research. Idealistically, this game contains two types of players: the researchers and the public (beneficiaries), alongside two goals: to further humanities' knowledge of the universe and its contents, and to advance the world technologically in a way which benefits humanity. Here, to avoid tangents about morality and ethics, “benefitting humanity” is defined as the ethically optimal objective in a Platonic sense (which may also include benefitting other organisms). The academic system would ideally incentivize actions which adheres to the furthering of these goals, including conducting beneficial research, spreading knowledge and enabling for technological innovation.

However, when applying a game theoretic perspective to the complex world we live in, it is important to remember that the players are involved in several games, which may have conflicting goals. Indeed, researchers are humans too, and therefore share the egoistic goals of humans, centered around economic security and gain of power. Most researchers therefore also strive for academic fame, which is accompanied by a larger paycheck and greater influence. The researcher now has three goals: the two ideal ones mentioned in the previous section and to become a famous researcher. 

Fame is created by the acknowledgement and opinion of the public and of peers. If the public thinks you are famous, you are. If we wish to keep the researchers goals aligned with the ideal goals, it is therefore pertinent that the public and the peers share these goals, and that the public receives an unbiased view of the scientific work so that their assessment also is unbiased. We have now introduced a new player into the game, namely the communicator between the researcher, their peers, and the public, which in actuality are the scientific journals.

The power the journals hold in academia is that of selecting and spreading research findings. They therefore play an important part in furthering and extending the border of knowledge, but they also play a large role in governing the influence and fame of researchers. It is therefore crucial that journals uphold a level of integrity and that they are regulated so that they don't sway from the goal of science and placate to the egoistic needs of humans. Unfortunately, this is exactly what is currently undergoing in the game of academia.

Journals are highly efficient profit machines which dictate the success of researchers while exploiting their flaws as humans as well as their institutions for monetary gain. They play their own game, in which impact factors are a proxy for profit and their tactics include utilizing researchers as editors, reviewers and publishers, creating a money-printing cycle where researchers run like hamsters in the pursuit of scientific glory. 

As long as the journal system exists in its current state, there will always be a misalignment between the ideal goals and the incentives of the researchers. This results in bad research, where the goal is to publish in high-impact journals instead of doing good science, resulting in reporting bias, fraud, and hype-trains. Although the downstream impact of such research is unclear, it is reasonable to believe that research without such systems in place would generate better science, which in turn would make the world a better place. The diversion from such a world is morally wrong.

## How to align incentives with goals
While it is possible to imagine a scenario where the researchers are unaffected by the incentives of journals, and uphold a moral standard which further the ideal goals of research, it seems like a highly unlikely one, since any player which diverges from this tactic ruins the game by immediately becoming the most famous researcher in the world. It is not a steady equilibrium. It is therefore necessary to change the system to align the incentives with the ideal goals, which means to alter the way in which research is evaluated and spread to the public and to peers.

But how can science be spread in an unbiased way which doesn't incentivize the researchers deviate from the desired outcome? This is a difficult question of which I have no definitive answer. However, there are two actions which seem overwhelmingly clear, and which have been raised by others, and would improve the publishing system:

1. Abandon the journals and pre-publication peer review, and move to pre-print like servers. These include an initial check for obviously obnoxious publications, but otherwise lets everything through. 
2. Make post-publication peer review open.

These actions would remove the monetization from the publication system, reduce the time of publication and thereby increase the rate of scientific exchange, and reduce the level of gatekeeping currently upheld by monopolized publishing companies. Journals to play an important role in identifying good research, but this can be done just as easily with post-publication peer review.

This model has already been adopted by some newer fields of research, such as machine learning (ML)/AI. Especially for mathematics and ML-research, journals rarely hold any power, and arXiv is the name of the game. Publications are sometimes spread through alternative channels across the web, and some papers become viral if they are regarded as worthy of mentions. Alternative decentralized ways of funding, doing, and reporting science utilizing the Web3 stack are on the come-up (called DeSci), but I don't know if these will catch on. In general, I believe that the two points above is enough to fix the problems with journals. Further, they are actionable and available now.
